# Initial Concept

AURA is an autonomous, agent-driven CLI designed for complex software development tasks like discovery, planning, coding, and system evolution. Analyzed existing Python codebase with modular Agentic OS architecture.


# AURA: Autonomous Unified Reliable Agentic OS

## Vision
AURA is a high-performance, deterministic Agent OS designed to serve as a force-multiplier for both Software Engineers and autonomous AI Agents. It provides a reliable foundation for complex, recursive software development tasks through a unified control plane.

## Target Audience
- **Software Engineers:** Seeking terminal-based productivity and deep observability into agentic workflows.
- **AI Agents:** Requiring a stable, tiered operating system for autonomous task execution and memory persistence.

## Primary Goals
- **Deterministic Orchestration:** Establish a reliable, phase-based pipeline for software engineering.
- **Agentic Reliability:** Enforce strict safety policies and deterministic project synchronization to ensure system integrity.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Provide a multi-tiered memory architecture capable of handling long-running project contexts.

## Core Features
- **Advanced Semantic Context Management (ASCM v2):** Token-aware context assembly with deep provenance and metadata filtering.
- **Multi-Tiered Memory System:** A distributed "brain" utilizing SQLite for local persistence and Momento for low-latency session caching.
- **Autonomous Discovery:** Self-directed scanning of codebases to identify architectural hotspots and testing gaps.

## User Experience
- **Reliability First:** Prioritizing safety and consistency in every autonomous modification.
- **Visibility:** Real-time monitoring via AURA Studio and structured log streaming.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized memory recall and fast execution cycles.
